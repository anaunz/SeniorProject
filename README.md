This project is parts of CPE401 and CPE402, also known as Senior Project. Also, this project is implemented for the purpose of competition in National Software Contest 2020 (NSC2020).

## Abstract
Currently, there are many problems with waste pollution, for example, air pollution problems caused by landfill or water pollution problems from dumping waste into rivers and seas. These problems affect both the physical health of people and the surrounding environment. Thailand is also one country that has been dealing with a growing amount of waste. However, the ability to properly manage waste in that country is in the opposite direction. One of the ways to reduce the mentioned problems is to have efficient waste management, such as waste separation, waste recycling, and convenience management, etc. This project aims to create a system that enables efficient waste management. The application provides knowledge about waste using image processing techniques. The prices of waste that can be sold will be shown to increases incentives for waste management. Moreover, users can buy or sell junk easily using the trading system in the application for their convenience. Also, we provide some inside-information through data visualization so that those involved in waste management can take these data for further analysis.
